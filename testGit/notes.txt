Version Control System
> What is version control
> Need for version control
	1. many developers  simultaneously working on a single integrated system
	2. changes done for bug fixing | overwriting | unauthorized changes made on the code(when code should/should not be modify)
	3. local copies for each developer(older code getting integrated) | maintaining different code bases -> human dependency(not good)
	4. need for reverting to an older version of the software (rollback to the stable version)

Example :-
Problem :
	[developer 1 .... ]
		{whose code should be finalized? }
		{delpoying the partial code version 1.1.0 instead of 1.5.0}
		{overwriting their own code}
		{no audit tracking}
		{time intensive rollback}
		{not scalable for large scale org}
		{server crashes}
	[developer 2 .... ]

Solution :
	[developer 1]
		      -> 	[Repository] 	 	-> [server/production]
	[developer 2]	{simulated on live system}
			{labelling the version} 
			{other developers work on file from repo and push their version of code}
	
Types of version control software :
	1. Central Repository
		>  check-in : developer to repos | check-out : repos to developer
		> commit : to the repos from dvpr (write) | update : the dvpr machine/code with the latest code (read)
		Eg : 
		Limitation :
			> single point failure
			> requires constant connection
			> 
	2. Distributed Repository
		> here in addition to remote repos, each developer also has a local repo ie loss of connection is averted
		> local copies of code maintained on the developers machine and/or remote server
		> 2 stage process
		   commit : to the local repo | push : to the central repo (write to the repo)
		   update : from the local repo | pull : from the central repo (read from the repo)
		Eg :

Git
	WORKSPACE -> INDEX -> LOCAL_REPOSITORY -> REMOTE_REPOSITORY
what is workspace? local copy of the code on the machine | independent of the ide/
what is index? aka staging area where the code is added to maintain a copy of what we work on| closely mimcs the local repo
local repository? stable version of code committed here | local area for all code
remote repository? central repo where the code is dhared; can be public/private 

git constantly tracks the version of the document i.e. machine copy different from the index copy

git commands
	git add file1 : adds file1 from the workspace to the index/staging area
	git commit file1 -comment1 : adds file1 from the staging area to the local area
	git push : adds file1 from the local repo to the remote repo (onto GitHub) | staging area still has the file


// steps
*do not use spaces in the dir, file names*
*add "file.py" around the file name while saving to directory to avoid saving it as a txt file*
1. create an empty directory in any drive
2. initiate the git coverage > tell git to track this directory > open cmd from directory
3. git [Enter] ... list of commands
4. add files to the local repo
5. open github and create a repo 

		           git init -> instructs git to track current directory | creates a file with .git where it is maintaining the versions -- hidden folder
     cmd		           dir /ah ->	to see hidden attributes i.e hidden files in the current directory
  git bash ls -la   			->    -"-
            	git status  		-> files not tracked is in red i.e is in the workspace
          	git add ... 		-> adds file to the index
  	git commit ... -m "comment" 	-> adds file to the remote repos with the comment as desc
	git add .			-> add all the files onto the local repo
	git diff			-> difference in the same file [deleted : red | added : green]

Branch and Merge
add new features of an existing code on the features, dvpr1 and dvpr2 create an addtional branch b1, b2 stemming from the main branch of the code
this avoids overwriting each others code and maintain separate documents
after merging the master branch and the b1 branch are the same level -> synchronize the code periodically with other developers
final production ready code -> merging all the branches stemming out to create a single file
